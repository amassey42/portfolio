# portfolio

## Description

This project was to create a portfolio to showcase all my upcoming projects. The goal of this project was to make elements that move with the different viewport sizes so that it is accessable on many different devices users could be looking at it from. I used flexbox to allow my website to be accessable on different devices. Clicking the Nav Bar links will take you to the different sections of the webpage. Contact me links will take you to your default email program and input my email. Github link will take you to my github link in a new tab.
